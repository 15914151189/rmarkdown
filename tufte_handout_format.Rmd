Tufte Handouts are documents formatted in the style that Edward Tufte uses in his books and handouts. Tufteâ€™s style is known for its extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and well-set typography:

<div class="row">
<div class="thumbnail span9 offset1">
<img src="images/tufte-handout.png" class="img-thumbnail"/>
</div>
</div>

<br/>

The Tufte Handout format has been moved from the **rmarkdown** package to the **tufte** package which you can install as follows:

```r
install.packages("tufte")
```

For an extensive example and documentation on using the **tufte** package see <http://rstudio.github.io/tufte/>.
