R Markdown files provide a [notebook interface for R](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html), which makes it easy to test and iterate on code while authoring your file. The RStudio IDE will display the results of each code chunk beneath the chunk in your source editor.

## Notebook Output

Set the `output: html_notebook`



can be used as a notebook
Your R Markdown file is itself a notebook. Share it.

Notebook File
When a notebook .Rmd is saved, an .nb.html file is created alongside it. This file is a self-contained HTML file which contains both a rendered copy of the notebook with all current chunk outputs (suitable for display on a website) and a copy of the notebook .Rmd itself.

You can view the .nb.html file in any ordinary web browser. It can also be opened in RStudio; when you open there (using e.g. File -> Open), RStudio will do the following:

Extract the bundled .Rmd file and place it alongside the .nb.html file
Open the .Rmd file in a new RStudio editor tab
Extract the chunk outputs from the .nb.html file and place them appropriately in the editor
Note that the .nb.html file is only created for R Markdown documents which are notebooks (i.e. at least one of their output formats is html_notebook). It’s possible to have an R Markdown document which includes inline chunk output but does not produce an .nb.html file.

Output Storage
The document’s chunk outputs are also stored in an internal RStudio folder beneath the project’s .Rproj.user folder. If you work with a notebook but don’t have a project open, the outputs are stored in the RStudio state folder in your home directory (the location of this folder varies between the desktop and the server).

##  Version Control

One of the major advantages of R Notebooks compared to other notebook systems is that they are plain-text files and therefore work well with version control. We recommend checking in both the .Rmd and .nb.html files into version control so that both your source code and output are available to collaborators. However, you can choose to include only the .Rmd file (with a .gitignore that excludes the .nb.html) if you want each collaborator to work with their own private copies of the output.
