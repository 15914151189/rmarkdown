In addition to executing R code chunks, the [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) package can also execute chunks in a variety of other languages. Some of the available language engines include:

* Python
* SQL
* Bash
* Rcpp
* Stan
* JavaScript
* CSS

To process a code chunk using an alternate language engine you simply use the name of the engine in place of `r` in your chunk declaration, for example:

```{r echo = FALSE, comment = ""}
cat(htmltools::includeText("demos/bash.Rmd"))
```

## Example

The python engine enables execution of python code via an external python interpreter (the interpreter returned by `Sys.which("python")` is used to execute the code). Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```{r echo = FALSE, comment = ""}
cat(htmltools::includeText("demos/python.Rmd"))
```

```{python, echo = FALSE}
x = 'hello, python world!'
print(x.split(' '))
```

Note that chunk options like `echo` and `results` are all valid when using a language engine like python.
