R Markdown documents can contain a metadata section that includes title, author, and date information as well as options for customizing output. For example, this metadata included at the top of an .Rmd file adds a title, author, and date to your document.

```

title: "Report with date"
author: "RStudio"
date: "2016-06-23"
---
```

You can add a `params:` field to the metadata to provide a list of values for your document to use. R Markdown will make the list available as `params` within any R code chunk in the report. For example, the file below takes a filename as a parameter and uses the name to read in a data set. To use multiple parameters, list each one on a new line under `params:`, indented two spaces.

Parameters let you quickly apply your data set to new data sets, models, and parameters. You can set new values for the parameters when you call `rmarkdown::render()`,

```r
rmarkdown::render("input.Rmd", params = list())
```

as well as when you press the "Knit" button:

You can learn more about params at [Paramaterized Reports](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/developer_parameterized_reports.html).

## Exercise

Add two parameters to [your report](lesson-exercises/exercise-5.Rmd), `symbol1` and `symbol2`. You can use "FB" (Facebook) and "GOOG" (Google) as their default values. Then replace every instance of `"AMZN"` or `"AAPL"` in your code with one of the parameters.

When you Knit with Parameters, R Markdown will let you choose two new stocks to examine. For now, your text will still refer to AMZN and AAPL, but your graphs will update.
