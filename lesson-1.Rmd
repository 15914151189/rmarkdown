# Getting Started

### Overview

![](lesson-images/RMarkdownFlow.png)

Creating documents with R Markdown starts with an .Rmd file that contains a combination of markdown (content with simple text formatting) and R code chunks. The .Rmd file is fed to [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/), which executes all of the R code chunks and creates a new markdown (.md) document which includes the R code and it's output.

The markdown file generated by knitr is then processed by [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) which is responsible for creating a finished web page, PDF, MS Word document, slide show, handout, book, dashboard, package vignette or other format.

This may sound complicated, but R Markdown makes it extremely simple by encapsulating all of the above processing into a single `render` function. Better still, RStudio includes a "Knit" button that enables you to render an .Rmd and preview it using a single click or keyboard shortcut.

### Installation

You can install the R Markdown package from CRAN as follows:

```r
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

You can open a new .Rmd file in the RStudio IDE by going to File > New File > R Markdown... RStudio IDE opens a window that let's you select a template of content for your new file, which you can then modify or overwrite. To open your file, select a template and then click enter.

## Exercise

Think you have it? Install the current versions of R Markdown. Then:

1. Open a new R Markdown file in the IDE (start with an HTML document template)
2. Render the document by clicking the knit button at the top of the file
3. Compare the output with the .Rmd file
4. Find the .html output file on your computer
