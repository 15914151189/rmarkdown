## Slide Basics

You can create a slide show broken up into sections by using the \# and
\#\# heading tags (you can also create a new slide without a header
using a horizontal rule (`----------`). For example here's a simple
slide show:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    author: John Doe
    date: March 22, 2005
    output: beamer_presentation
    ---

    # In the morning

    ## Getting up

    - Turn off alarm
    - Get out of bed

    ## Breakfast

    - Eat eggs
    - Drink coffee

    # In the evening

    ## Dinner

    - Eat spaghetti
    - Drink wine

    ----------

    ## Going to sleep

    - Get in bed
    - Count sheep

## Incremental Bullets

You can render bullets incrementally by adding the `incremental` option:

    ---
    output:
      beamer_presentation:
        incremental: true
    ---

If you want to render bullets incrementally for some slides but not
others you can use this syntax:

    > - Eat eggs
    > - Drink coffee

## Themes

You can specify Beamer themes using the `theme`, `colortheme`, and `fonttheme` options:

   ---
    output:
      beamer_presentation:
        theme: "AnnArbor"
        colortheme: "dolphin"
        fonttheme: "structurebold"
    ---

## Slide Level

The `slide_level` option defines the heading level that defines individual slides.  By default this is the highest header level in the hierarchy that is followed immediately by content, and not another header, somewhere in the document. This default can be overridden by specifying an explicit `slide_level`:

    ---
    output:
      beamer_presentation:
        slide_level: 2
    ---

## Figures

There are a number of options that affect the output of figures within HTML documents:

* `fig_width` and `fig_height` can be used to control the default figure width and height (6 x 4.5 is used by default)

* `fig_crop` controls whether the the pdfcrop utility (if available) is automatically applied to pdf figures (this is true by default).

* `fig_caption` controls whether figures are rendered with captions (this is true by default).

For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      beamer_presentation:
        fig_width: 7
        fig_height: 6
        fig_caption: true
