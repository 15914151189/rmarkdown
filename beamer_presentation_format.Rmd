## Slide Basics

You can create a slide show broken up into sections by using the \# and
\#\# heading tags (you can also create a new slide without a header
using a horizontal rule (`----------`). For example here's a simple
slide show:

    ## Going to sleep

    - Get in bed
    - Count sheep

## Incremental Bullets

You can render bullets incrementally by adding the `incremental` option:

    ---
    output:
      beamer_presentation:
        incremental: true
    ---

If you want to render bullets incrementally for some slides but not
others you can use this syntax:

    > - Eat eggs
    > - Drink coffee

## Themes

You can specify Beamer themes using the `theme`, `colortheme`, and `fonttheme` options:

   ---
    output:
      beamer_presentation:
        theme: "AnnArbor"
        colortheme: "dolphin"
        fonttheme: "structurebold"

## Slide Level

The `slide_level` otion defines the heading level that defines individual slides.  By default this is the highest header level in the hierarchy that is followed immediately by content, and not another header, somewhere in the document. This default can be overridden by specifying an explicit `slide_level`:

    ---
    output:
      beamer_presentation:
        slide_level: 2
