## Overview

To create a PDF document from R Markdown you specify the `pdf_document` output format in the front-matter of your document:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    author: John Doe
    date: March 22, 2005
    output: pdf_document
    ---

## Table of Contents

You can add a table of contents using the `toc` option and specify the depth of headers that it applies to using the `toc_depth` option. For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      pdf_document:
        toc: true
        toc_depth: 2
    ---

If the table of contents depth isn't explicitly specified then it defaults to 3 (meaning that all level 1, 2, and 3 headers will be included in the table of contents).

You can add section numbering to headers using the `number_sections` option:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      pdf_document:
        toc: true
        number_sections: true
    ---


## Figure Options

There are a number of options that affect the output of figures within HTML documents:

* `fig_width` and `fig_height` can be used to control the default figure width and height (6 x 4.5 is used by default)

* `fig_crop` controls whether the the pdfcrop utility (if available) is automatically applied to pdf figures (this is true by default).

* `fig_caption` controls whether figures are rendered with captions (this is true by default).

For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      pdf_document:
        fig_width: 7
        fig_height: 6
        fig_caption: true
    ---

## Syntax Higlighting

The `highlight` option specifies the syntax highlighting style. Supported styles include "default", "tango", "pygments", "kate", "monochrome", "espresso", "zenburn", "haddock", and "textmate" (specify null to prevent syntax highlighting):

For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      pdf_document:
        highlight: tango
    ---

## Advanced Customization

You can do more advanced customization of PDF output by including additional LaTeX directives and/or content or by replacing the core pandoc template entirely. To include content in the document header or before/after the document body you use the `includes` option as follows:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      pdf_document:
        includes:
          in_header: header.tex
          before_body: doc_prefix.tex
          after_body: doc_suffix.tex
    ---

You can also replace the underlying pandoc template using the `template` option:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      pdf_document:
        template: quarterly_report.tex
    ---

Consult the documentation on [pandoc templates](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example9/templates.html) for additional details on templates. You can also study the [default LaTeX template](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-templates/blob/master/default.latex) as an example.

The `includes` and `template` options take relative paths to files by default. However, you may also want to specify that the referenced files live in an alternate directory (so they don't need to be copied to the document directory). You can do this using the `data_dir` option:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      pdf_document:
        data_dir: ~/templates/reports
        template: quarterly_report.tex
