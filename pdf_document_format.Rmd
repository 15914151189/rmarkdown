title: "PDF Documents"

## Overview

To create a PDF document from R Markdown you specify the `pdf_document` output format in the front-matter of your document:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    author: John Doe
    date: March 22, 2005
    output: pdf_document
    ---

## Table of Contents

You can add a table of contents using the `toc` option and specify the depth of headers that it applies to using the `toc_depth` option. For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      pdf_document:
        toc: true
        toc_depth: 2
    ---

If the table of contents depth isn't explicitly specified then it defaults to 3 (meaning that all level 1, 2, and 3 headers will be included in the table of contents).

You can add section numbering to headers using the `number_sections` option:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      pdf_document:
        toc: true
        number_sections: true
    ---


## Figure Options

There are a number of options that affect the output of figures within PD documents:

* `fig_width` and `fig_height` can be used to control the default figure width and height (6 x 4.5 is used by default)

* `fig_crop` controls whether the the pdfcrop utility (if available) is automatically applied to pdf figures (this is true by default).

* `fig_caption` controls whether figures are rendered with captions (this is true by default).

For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      pdf_document:
        fig_width: 7
        fig_height: 6
        fig_caption: true
    ---

## Syntax Highlighting

The `highlight` option specifies the syntax highlighting style. Supported styles include "default", "tango", "pygments", "kate", "monochrome", "espresso", "zenburn", and "haddock" (specify null to prevent syntax highlighting):

For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      pdf_document:
        highlight: tango
    ---

## Bibliography Options

You can specify the use of natbib or biblatex for citations in LaTeX output using the `natbib` and `biblatex` options. For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      pdf_document:
        natbib: true
    ---


## LaTeX Options

Many aspects of the LaTeX template used to create PDF documents can be customized using top-level YAML metadata (note that these options do not appear underneath the `output` section but rather appear at the top level along with title, author, etc.). For example:

    ---
    title: "Crop Analysis Q3 2013"
    output: pdf_document
    fontsize: 11pt
    geometry: margin=1in
    ---

Available metadata variables include:

Variable|Description
--------|-----------
lang|Document language code
fontsize|Font size (e.g. 10pt, 11pt, 12pt)
documentclass|LaTeX document class (e.g. article)
classoption|Option for documentclass (e.g. oneside); may be repeated
geometry|Options for geometry class (e.g. margin=1in); may be repeated
mainfont, sansfont, monofont, mathfont|Document fonts (works only with xelatex and lualatex, see the `latex_engine` option)
linkcolor, urlcolor, citecolor|Color for internal, external, and citation links (red, green, magenta, cyan, blue, black)
biblio-style|LaTeX bibliography style (used with `natbib` option)
biblio-files|Bibliography files to use in LaTeX (used with `natbib` or `biblatex` options)

## Advanced Customization

### LaTeX Engine

By default PDF documents are rendered using pdflatex. You can specify an alternate engine using the `latex_engine` option. Available engines are "pdflatex", "xelatex", and "lualatex". For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      pdf_document:
        latex_engine: xelatex
    ---

### Keeping Intermediate TeX

R Markdown documents are converted to PDF by first converting to a TeX file and then calling the LaTeX engine to convert to PDF. By default this TeX file is removed, however if you want to keep it (e.g. for an article submission) you can specify the `keep_tex` option. For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      pdf_document:
        keep_tex: true
    ---

### Includes

You can do more advanced customization of PDF output by including additional LaTeX directives and/or content or by replacing the core pandoc template entirely. To include content in the document header or before/after the document body you use the `includes` option as follows:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      pdf_document:
        includes:
          in_header: header.tex
          before_body: doc_prefix.tex
          after_body: doc_suffix.tex
    ---

### Custom Templates

You can also replace the underlying pandoc template using the `template` option:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      pdf_document:
        template: quarterly_report.tex
    ---

Consult the documentation on [pandoc templates](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example9/templates.html) for additional details on templates. You can also study the [default LaTeX template](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-templates/blob/master/default.latex) as an example.

### Specifying a Data Directory

The `includes` and `template` options take relative paths to files by default. However, you may also want to specify that the referenced files live in an alternate directory (so they don't need to be copied to the document directory). You can do this using the `data_dir` option:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      pdf_document:
        data_dir: ~/templates/reports
        template: quarterly_report.tex
    ---

### Pandoc Arguments

If there are pandoc features you want to use that lack equivilants in the YAML options described above you can still use them by passing custom `pandoc_args`. For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      pdf_document:
        pandoc_args: [
          "--no-tex-ligatures"
        ]
    ---

Documentation on all available pandoc arguments can be found in the [pandoc user guide](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#options).
