## Overview

To create a PDF document from R Markdown you specify the `pdf_document` output format in the front-matter of your document:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    author: John Doe
    date: March 22, 2005
    output: pdf_document
    ---

## Table of Contents

You can add a table of contents using the `toc` option and specify the depth of headers that it applies to using the `toc_depth` option. For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      pdf_document:
        toc: true
        toc_depth: 2
    ---

If the table of contents depth isn't explicitly specified then it defaults to 3 (meaning that all level 1, 2, and 3 headers will be included in the table of contents).

You can add section numbering to headers using the `number_sections` option:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      pdf_document:
        toc: true
        number_sections: true
    ---


## Figures

There are a number of options that affect the output of figures within HTML documents:

* `fig_width` and `fig_height` can be used to control the default figure width and height (6 x 4.5 is used by default)

* `fig_crop` controls whether the the pdfcrop utility (if available) is automatically applied to pdf figures (this is true by default).

* `fig_caption` controls whether figures are rendered with captions (this is true by default).

For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      pdf_document:
        fig_width: 7
        fig_height: 6
        fig_caption: true
    ---

## Syntax Higlighting

The `highlight` option specifies the syntax highlighting style. Supported styles include "default", "tango", "pygments", "kate", "monochrome", "espresso", "zenburn", "haddock", and "textmate" (specify null to prevent syntax highlighting):

For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      pdf_document:
        highlight: tango
    ---
