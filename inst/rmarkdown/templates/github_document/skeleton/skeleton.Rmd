## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated. An HTML file is also generated for the purpose of local preview (the HTML file need not be checked into GitHub).

Note that the markdown syntax supported within this document is [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/).

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
