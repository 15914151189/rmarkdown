# Introduction

Vignettes are long form documentation commonly included in packages. Because they are part of the distribution of the package, they need to be as compact as possible. The `html_vignette` output type provides a custom style sheet (and tweaks some options) to ensure that the resulting html is as small as possible.

## Metadata

Note that all Rmarkdown vignettes need to include the following code somewhere in the document:

    \VignetteEngine{knitr::knitr}
    \VignetteIndexEntry{Vignette title}
    \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

(Yes, they look like latex commands, even though this is an Rmarkdown document.) I recommend putting keeping them in the yaml metadata, as in this template.

## Figures

The figure sizes have been customised so that you can easily put two images side-by-side. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot(1:10)
plot(10:1)
```
