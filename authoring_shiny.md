## Overview

R Markdown has been extended to support fully interactive documents. Unlike the more traditional workflow of creating static reports, you can now create documents that allow your readers to change the assumptions underlying your analysis and see the results immediately.   

R Markdown leverages [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) at it's core to make this possible. Here is a simple example of an R Markdown document with an interactive plot:

![Shiny Hist Plot](images/shiny-interactive-plot.png)

Note that the reader of this document is able to manipulate the number of bins and bandwidth adjustment which in turn automatically updates the plot to reflect the changes. 

Adding an interactive plot to a document is straightfoward: simply wrap the code used to generate the plot in the `renderPlot` function and define the user inputs required to make the plot dynamic. For example, here's what the code used to generate the document above looks like:

Shiny Docs aren't limited to longer form HTML documents, you can also embed Shiny components directly within HTML presentations:

Shiny Docs combine the expressiveness of R Markdown with the interactivity of Shiny. These documents can be run locally on the desktop or be deployed to [ShinyApps](http://shinyapps.io) or Shiny Server v1.2 (see the [Deployment] section below for more details).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Working with Shiny Docs requires an up to date version of the [RStudio Preview Release](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/preview) (v0.98.894 or later) so be sure to update RStudio before trying out these features. 

The [RStudio Preview Release](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/preview) includes everything you need to create Shiny documents (including the latest development version of the Shiny package). If you are not using RStudio you can also install the required versions of **rmarkdown** and **shiny** as follows:

```r
devtools::install_github(c("rstudio/rmarkdown", rstudio/shiny"))
```

### Creating a Shiny Doc

To create a new Shiny Doc open the **New R Markdown** dialog in RStudio and choose to create a document with the "Shiny Document" template:

![New R Markdown Shiny Document](images/new-shiny-document.png)

You can run a document locally using the **Run Document** command on the editor toolbar, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+K (Cmd+Shift+K on Mac):

![Shiny Run Document](images/shiny-run-document.png)

Note that this command runs the document in a separate R process, so you can continue to use the R console while the document is running. You can see any R console output from this separate process in the R Markdown console tab in RStudio. 

If you're not using RStudio, or want to run the document in-process for troubleshooting, you can also run the document from the console using the `rmarkdown::run` function.

### Inputs and Outputs

You can embed Shiny inputs and outputs in your document. Outputs are automatically updated whenever inputs change. In this example we create a `numericInput` with the name "rows" and then refer to its value via `input$rows` when generating output:

<pre class="markdown"><code>&#96;&#96;&#96;{r, echo = FALSE}
numericInput("rows", "How many cars?", 5)

renderTable({
  head(cars, input$rows)
})
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</code></pre>

In this example the output code was wrapped in a call to `renderTable`. There are many other render functions in Shiny that can be used for plots, printed R output, and more. This example uses `renderPlot` to create dynamic plot output:

<pre class="markdown"><code>&#96;&#96;&#96;{r, echo = FALSE}
sliderInput("bins", "Number of bins:", min = 1, max = 50, value = 30)

renderPlot({
  x <- faithful[, 2]  # Old Faithful Geyser data
  bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)

  # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins
  hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')
})
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</code></pre>

If you havenâ€™t used Shiny before some of the above code will be unfamiliar to you. The [Shiny Tutorial](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial) is a good place to learn more.

## Deployment

### ShinyApps

You can publish Shiny Docs to the [ShinyApps](http://shinyapps.io) hosted service. To do this you should ensure that you have:

1. An account on ShinyApps (use the [signup form](http://shinyapps.io) to request an account).

2. The very latest version of the **shinyapps** R package. You can install this as follows:

```r
devtools::install_github("rstudio/shinyapps")
```

You can then deploy a Shiny Doc the same way that you currently deploy Shiny apps. From the working directory containing the document(s) just execute:

```r
shinyapps::deployApp()
```

If you are using RStudio you can also use the **Deploy** button available when working with a Shiny Doc:

![Shinyapps Deploy](images/shinyapps-deploy.png)

### Shiny Server

Deploying Shiny Docs is not yet supported by [Shiny Server]((http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/server/)). However, support is forthcoming in Shiny Server v1.2 which is scheduled for release in mid-June.


## Learning More

This introduction just scratches the surface of the types of interactive documents you can create with R Markdown and Shiny. See the following resources to learn more:

1. [Embedded Shiny Apps](authoring_embedded_shiny.html) describes how you can embed entire Shiny applications inside an R Markdown document.

2. [Creating Shiny Widgets](authoring_shiny_widgets.html) covers creating re-usable Shiny widgets that enable others to embed interactive components in their documents with a single function call.

3. [Advanced Topics](authoring_shiny_advanced.html) includes details on converting existing R Markdown documents to Shiny Docs and creating multiple-page Shiny Docs.

4. Finally, the [Shiny Dev Center](http://shiny.rstudio.com) includes extensive articles, tutorials, and examples to help you learn more about Shiny.
