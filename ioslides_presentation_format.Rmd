## Slide Basics

You can create a slide show broken up into sections by using the \# and
\#\# heading tags (you can also create a new slide without a header
using a horizontal rule (`----------`). For example here's a simple
slide show:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    author: John Doe
    date: March 22, 2005
    output: ioslides_presentation
    ---

    # In the morning

    ## Getting up

    - Turn off alarm
    - Get out of bed

    ## Breakfast

    - Eat eggs
    - Drink coffee

    # In the evening

    ## Dinner

    - Eat spaghetti
    - Drink wine

    ----------

    ![picture of spaghetti](images/spaghetti.jpg)

    ## Going to sleep

    - Get in bed
    - Count sheep

You can add a subtitle to a slide or section by including text after the
pipe (|) character. For example:

    ## Getting up | What I like to do first thing

## Display Modes

The following single character keyboard shortcuts enable alternate
display modes:

-   `'f'` enable fullscreen mode

-   `'w'` toggle widescreen mode

-   `'o'` enable overview mode

-   `'h'` enable code highlight mode

-   `'p'` show presenter notes

Pressing `Esc` exits all of these modes. See the sections below on *Code
Highlighting* and *Presenter Mode* for additional detail on those modes.

## Incremental Bullets

You can render bullets incrementally by adding the `incremental` option:

    ---
    output:
      ioslides_presentation:
        incremental: true
    ---

If you want to render bullets incrementally for some slides but not
others you can use this syntax:

    > - Eat eggs
    > - Drink coffee

### Presentation Size

You can display the presentation using a wider form factor using the
`widescreen` option. You can specify that smaller text be used with the
`smaller` option. For example:

    ---
    output:
      ioslides_presentation:
        widescreen: true
        smaller: true
    ---

You can also enable the `smaller` option on a slide-by-slide basis by
adding the `.smaller` attibute to the slide header:

    ## Getting up {.smaller}

## Adding a Logo

You can add a logo to the presentation using the `logo` option (the logo
should be square and at least 128x128). For example:

    ---
    output:
      ioslides_presentation:
        logo: logo.png
    ---

A 128x128 version of the logo graphic will be added to the title slide
and an icon version of the logo will be included in the bottom-left
footer of each slide.

## Build Slides

Slides can also have a `.build` attribute that indicate that their
content should be displayed incrementally. For example:

    ## Getting up {.build}

Slide attributes can be combined if you need to specify more than one,
for example:

    ## Getting up {.smaller .build}

## Code Highlighting

It's possible to select subsets of code for additional emphasis by
adding a special "highlight" comment around the code. For example:

    ### <b>
    x <- 10
    y <- x * 2
    ### </b>

The highlighted region will be displayed with a bold font. When you want
to help the audience focus exclusively on the highlighted region press
the `'h'` key and the rest of the code will fade away.

## Tables

The ioslides template has an attractive default style for tables so you
shouldn't hestiate to add tables for presenting more complex sets of
information. Pandoc markdown supports several syntaxes for defining
tables which are described in the [pandoc markdown
specification](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example9/pandocs-markdown.html).

## Advanced Layout

You can center content on a slide by adding the `.flexbox` and
`.vcenter` attributes to the slide title. For example:

    ## Dinner {.flexbox .vcenter}

You can horizontally center content by enclosing it in a `div` tag with
class `centered`. For example:

    <div class="centered">
    This text is centered.
    </div>

You can do a two-column layout using the `columns-2` class. For example:

    <div class="columns-2">
      ![Image](image.png)

      - Bullet 1
      - Bullet 2
      - Bullet 3
    </div>

Note that content will flow accross the columns so if you want to have
an image on one side and text on the other you should make sure that the
image has sufficient height to force the text to the other side of the
slide.

## Text Color

You can color content using base color classes red, blue, green, yellow,
and gray (or variations of them e.g. red2, red3, blue2, blue3, etc.).
For example:

    <div class="red2">
    This text is red
    </div>

## Presenter Mode

A separate presenter window can also be opened (ideal for when you are
presenting on one screen but have another screen that's private to you).
The window stays in sync with the main presentation window and also
shows presenter notes and a thumbnail of the next slide. To enable
presenter mode add `?presentme=true` to the URL of the presentation, for
example:

    mypresentation.html?presentme=true

The presenter mode window will open and will always re-open with the
presentation until it's disabled with:

    mypresentation.html?presentme=false

To add presenter notes to a slide you include it within a "notes" `div`.
For example:

    <div class="notes">
    This is my note.
    - It can contain markdown
    - like this list
    </div>

## Printing and PDF Output

You can print an ioslides presentation from within browsers that have
good support for print CSS (i.e. as of this writing Google Chrome has
the best support). Printing maintains most of the visual styles of the
HTML version of the presentation.

To create a PDF version of a presentation you can use Print to PDF from
Google Chrome.


## MathJax

By default [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) scripts are included in HTML documents for rendering LaTeX and MathML equations. You can use the `mathjax` option to control how MathJax is included:

* Specify "default" to use an https URL from the official MathJax CDN.

* Specify "local" to use a local version of MathJax (which is copied into the output directory). Note that when using "local" you also need to set the `self_contained` option to false.

* Specify an alternate URL to load MathJax from another location.

* Specify null to exclude MathJax entirely.

For example, to use a local copy of MathJax:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      mathjax: "local"
      self_contained: false
    ---

To use a self-hsoted copy of MathJax:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      mathjax: "http://example.com/mathjax/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"
    ---

To exclude MathJax entirely:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      mathjax: null
    ---
