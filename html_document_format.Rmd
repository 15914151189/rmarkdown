## Overview

To create an HTML document from R Markdown you specify the `html_document` output format in the front-matter of your document:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    author: John Doe
    date: March 22, 2005
    output: html_document
    ---

## Table of Contents

You can add a table of contents using the `toc` option and specify the depth of headers that it applies to using the `toc_depth` option. For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      html_document:
        toc: true
        toc_depth: 2
    ---

If the table of contents depth isn't explicitly specified then it defaults to 3 (meaning that all level 1, 2, and 3 headers will be included in the table of contents).

## Figures

There are a number of options that affect the output of figures within HTML documents:

* `fig_width` and  `fig_height` can be used to control the default figure width and height (7x5 is used by default)

* `fig_retina` Specifies the scaling to perform for retina displays (defaults to 2, which currently works for all widely used retina displays). Note that this only takes effect if you are using knitr >= 1.5.21. Set to `null` to prevent retina scaling.

* `fig_caption` controls whether figures are rendered with captions

For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      html_document:
        fig_width: 7
        fig_height: 6
        fig_caption: true
    ---


## Visual Styles

There are two options that control the visual style of HTML documents:

* `theme` specifies the Bootstrap theme to use for the page (themes are drawn from the [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/) theme library). Valid themes include "default", "cerulean", "journal", "flatly", "readable", "spacelab", "united", "yeti", and "cosmo". Pass null for no theme (in this case you can use the `css` parameter to add your own styles).

* `highlight` specifies the syntax highlighting style. Supported styles include "default", "tango", "pygments", "kate", "monochrome", "espresso", "zenburn", "haddock", and "textmate". Pass null to prevent syntax highlighting.

For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      html_document:
        theme: united
        highlight: tango
    ---

## Custom CSS

You can add your own CSS to an HTML document using the `css` option:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      html_document:
        css: styles.css
    ---

If you want to provide all of the styles for the document from your own CSS you set the `theme` (and potentially `highlight`) to null:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      html_document:
        theme: null
        highlight: null
        css: styles.css
    ---

You can also target specific sections of documents with custom CSS by adding ids or classes to section headers wihtin your document. For example the following section
header:

    ## Next Steps {#nextsteps .emphasized}

Would enable you to apply CSS to all of it's content using either of the following CSS selectors:

    #nextsteps {
       color: blue;
    }

    .emphasized {
       font-size: 1.2em;
    }


## MathJax

By default [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) scripts are included in HTML documents for rendering LaTeX and MathML equations. You can use the `mathjax` option to control how MathJax is included:

* Specify "default" to use an https URL from the official MathJax CDN.

* Specify "local" to use a local version of MathJax (which is copied into the output directory). Note that when using "local" you also need to set the `self_contained` option to false.

* Specify an alternate URL to load MathJax from another location.

* Specify null to exclude MathJax entirely.

For example, to use a local copy of MathJax:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      html_document:
        mathjax: local
        self_contained: false
    ---

To use a self-hsoted copy of MathJax:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      html_document:
        mathjax: "http://example.com/mathjax/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"
    ---

To exclude MathJax entirely:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      html_document:
        mathjax: null
    ---

## Advanced Customization

You can do more advanced customization of PDF output by including additional HTML  content or by replacing the core pandoc template entirely. To include content in the document header or before/after the document body you use the `includes` option as follows:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      html_document:
        includes:
          in_header: header.html
          before_body: doc_prefix.html
          after_body: doc_suffix.html
    ---

You can also replace the underlying pandoc template using the `template` option:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      html_document:
        template: quarterly_report.html
    ---

Consult the documentation on [pandoc templates](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example9/templates.html) for additional details on templates. You can also study the [default HTML template](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-templates/blob/master/default.html) as an example.

The `includes` and `template` options take relative paths to files by default. However, you may also want to specify that the referenced files live in an alternate directory (so they don't need to be copied to the document directory). You can do this using the `data_dir` option:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      html_document:
        data_dir: ~/templates/reports
        template: quarterly_report.html
