## Slide Basics

You can create a slide show broken up into sections by using the \# and
\#\# heading tags (you can also create a new slide without a header
using a horizontal rule (`----------`). For example here's a simple
slide show:

## Display Modes

The following single character keyboard shortcuts enable alternate
display modes:

-   `'f'` enable fullscreen mode

-   `'o'` enable overview mode

Pressing `Esc` exits all of these modes.

## Incremental Bullets

You can render bullets incrementally by adding the `incremental` option:

    ---
    output:
      revealjs_presentation:
        incremental: true
    ---

If you want to render bullets incrementally for some slides but not
others you can use this syntax:

    > - Eat eggs
    > - Drink coffee

## Themes and Transitions

You can select from various themes using the `theme` option and select a transition style usign the `transition` option:

    ---
    output:
      revealjs_presentation:
        theme: sky
        transition: fade
    ---

Available themes are `default`, `simple`, `sky`, `beige`, `serif`, or `solarized`; Available transitions are `default`, `cube`, `page`, `concave`, `zoom`, `linear`, `fade`, or `none`.
