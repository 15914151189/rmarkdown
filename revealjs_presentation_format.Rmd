## Slide Basics

You can create a slide show broken up into sections by using the \# and
\#\# heading tags (you can also create a new slide without a header
using a horizontal rule (`----------`). For example here's a simple
slide show:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    author: John Doe
    date: March 22, 2005
    output: revealjs_presentation
    ---

    ----------

    ## Going to sleep

    - Get in bed
    - Count sheep

## Display Modes

The following single character keyboard shortcuts enable alternate
display modes:

-   `'f'` enable fullscreen mode

-   `'o'` enable overview mode

Pressing `Esc` exits all of these modes.

## Incremental Bullets

You can render bullets incrementally by adding the `incremental` option:

    ---
    output:
      revealjs_presentation:
        incremental: true
    ---

If you want to render bullets incrementally for some slides but not
others you can use this syntax:

    > - Eat eggs
    > - Drink coffee

## Themes and Transitions

You can select from various themes using the `theme` option and select a transition style using the `transition` option:

    ---
    output:
      revealjs_presentation:
        theme: sky
        transition: fade
    ---

Available themes are `default`, `simple`, `sky`, `beige`, `serif`, or `solarized`; Available transitions are `default`, `cube`, `page`, `concave`, `zoom`, `linear`, `fade`, or `none`.

## MathJax

By default [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) scripts are included in HTML documents for rendering LaTeX and MathML equations. You can use the `mathjax` option to control how MathJax is included:

* Specify "default" to use an https URL from the official MathJax CDN.

* Specify "local" to use a local version of MathJax (which is copied into the output directory). Note that when using "local" you also need to set the `self_contained` option to false.

* Specify an alternate URL to load MathJax from another location.

* Specify null to exclude MathJax entirely.

For example, to use a local copy of MathJax:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      revealjs_presentation:
        mathjax: local
        self_contained: false
    ---

To use a self-hosted copy of MathJax:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      revealjs_presentation:
        mathjax: "http://example.com/mathjax/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"
    ---

To exclude MathJax entirely:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      revealjs_presentation:
        mathjax: null
    ---
