title: "Paramaterized Reports"
---

R Markdown documents can have arbitrary parameters that are varied across differnet renderings. This capability can be used to create parameterized reports driven by R functions that call `rmarkdown::render` under the hook.

## Defining Parameters

All of the fields included in the YAML front-matter of an R Markdown document are available as a `params` list within the execution environment of the document. For example:

    ---
    title: "My Document"
    data: cars.csv
    ---
    
<pre class="markdown"><code>---
title: "My Document"

&#96;&#96;&#96;{r}

&#96;&#96;&#96;
</code></pre>
