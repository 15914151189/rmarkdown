## Overview

To create a Word document from R Markdown you specify the `word_document` output format in the front-matter of your document:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    author: John Doe
    date: March 22, 2005
    output: word_document
    ---

## Figure Options

There are a number of options that affect the output of figures within Word documents:

* `fig_width` and  `fig_height` can be used to control the default figure width and height (5x4 is used if not values are specified)

* `fig_caption` controls whether figures are rendered with captions

For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      word_document:
        fig_width: 5
        fig_height: 5
        fig_caption: true
    ---

## Syntax Highlighting

You can use the `highlight` option to control the syntax highlighting theme. For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      word_document:
        highlight: "tango"
    ---

Supported styles include "default", "tango", "pygments", "kate", "monochrome", "espresso", "zenburn", and "haddock". Pass `null` to prevent syntax highlighting.


## Style Reference

You can also specify a document to be used as as a style reference in producing a docx file. For best results, the reference docx should be a modified version of a docx file produced using rmarkdown. Pass "default" to use the default styles. You can do this with the `reference_docx` option:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      word_document:
        reference_docx: mystyles.docx
    ---

The `reference_docx` option takes a relative path by default. However, you may also want to specify that the file live in an alternate directory (so it doesn't need to be copied to the document directory). You can do this using the `data_dir` option:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      word_document:
        reference_docx: mystyles.docx
        data_dir: ~/reports/styles
    ---


## Pandoc Arguments

If there are pandoc features you want to use that lack equivilants in the YAML options described above you can still use them by passing custom `pandoc_args`. For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      word_document:
        pandoc_args: [
          "--csl", "/var/csl/acs-nano.csl"
        ]
    ---

Documentation on all available pandoc arguments can be found in the [pandoc user guide](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#options).
