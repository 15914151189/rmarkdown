## Overview

To create a Word document from R Markdown you specify the `word_document` output format in the front-matter of your document:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    author: John Doe
    date: March 22, 2005
    output: word_document
    ---

## Figures

There are a number of additional options that can be used to control output of Word documents:

* `fig_width` and  `fig_height` can be used to control the default figure width and height (5x4 is used if not values are specified)

* `fig_caption` controls whether figures are rendered with captions

For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      word_document:
        fig_width: 5
        fig_height: 5
        fig_caption: true
        highlight: "tango"
    ---

## Syntax Highlighting

You can use the `highlight` option to control the syntax highlighting theme. For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      word_document:
        highlight: "tango"
    ---

Supported styles include "default", "tango", "pygments", "kate", "monochrome", "espresso", "zenburn", and "haddock". Pass `null` to prevent syntax highlighting.


## Style Reference

You can also specify a document to be used as as a style reference in producing a docx file. For best results, the reference docx should be a modified version of a docx file produced using rmarkdown. Pass "default" to use the default styles. You can do this with the `reference_docx` option:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      word_document:
        reference_docx: mystyles.docx
