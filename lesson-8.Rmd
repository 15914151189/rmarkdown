You can generate a slide presentation from the same .Rmd file that you use to render reports. Each of R Markdown's presentation formats will intuitively divide your content into slides, with a new slide beginning at each first or second level header.

Insert a horizontal rule (`***`) into your document to create a manual slide break.

You can learn more about each of R Markdown's slide formats here:
