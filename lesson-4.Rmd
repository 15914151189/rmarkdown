You can insert code results into the text of an [.Rmd file](demos/3-inline.Rmd) by enclosing the code with `` `r `  ``.

Inline expressions do not take knitr options. R Markdown will always 

* hide the source code of an inline expression
* apply relevant text formatting to the results

As a result, inline output is indistinguishable from the surrounding text.
