title: R Markdown --- Dynamic Documents for R
---

***

R Markdown is an authoring format that enables easy creation of dynamic documents, presentations, and reports from R. It combines the core syntax of markdown (an easy-to-write plain text format) with embedded R code chunks that are run so their output can be included in the final document. R Markdown documents are fully *reproducible* (they can be automatically regenerated whenever underlying R code or data changes).

With R Markdown you can author a single source file that can be used to generate output in many formats including HTML, PDF, and MS Word. R Markdown isn't limited to just plain documents either, extensive support for HTML5 and PDF (Beamer) presentations is also included.

Under the hood R Markdown uses the [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) package for executing R code and dynamically generating output and [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) to convert markdown into an HTML, PDF, or Word document. A quick tour of the basics of R Markdown is included below.

#### Using R Markdown

You can use R Markdown either through the the integrated support for R Markdown within RStudio or via the **rmarkdown** package. To get started:

1. RStudio --- Install the current [RStudio Preview Release](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/preview).

2. Other envrionments --- Install the [rmarkdown package](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown) from GitHub.

## Quick tour

### Markdown basics

Markdown is a simple formatting language designed to make authoring content easy for everyone. Rather than writing complex markup code (e.g. HTML or LaTeX), Markdown enables the use of a syntax much more like plain-text email. For example the file on the left shows basic Markdown and the resulting output on the right:

### R code chunks

Within an R Markdown file, R Code Chunks can be embedded using the native Markdown syntax for fenced code regions. For example, the following code chunk computes a data summary and renders a plot as a PNG image:

![Markdown Chunk](images/markdownChunk.png)


### Inline R code

You can also evaluate R expressions inline by enclosing the expression within a single back-tick qualified with 'r'. For example, the following code:

![Markdown Inline](images/markdownInline.png)

Results in this output: "I counted 2 red trucks on the highway."

### Embedding equations

You can embed LaTeX or MathML equations in R Markdown files using the following syntax:

* *`$equation$`* for inline equations (note there must not be whitespace adjacent to the $ delimiters)
* *`$$ equation $$`* for display equations
* *`<math ...> </math>`* for MathML equations.

For example:

## Next steps

### Learning more

With the basics described above you can get started with R Markdown right away. To learn more see:

* The website for the [knitr package](http://yihui.name/knitr/). Knitr is an extremely powerful tool for dynamic content generation and the website has a wealth of documentation and examples to help you utilize it to it's full potential.
* The full specification of [pandoc markdown](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#pandocs-markdown), which describes all of the markdown features and syntax available within R Markdown documents.

### Migrating to v2

The current implementation of R Markdown (v2) is an evolution of the original implementation, which was not based on pandoc but rather the [markdown](https://github.com/rstudio/markdown) package. Moving to pandoc brings many new features to R Markdown however carries some minor incompatibiliites with the prevoius implementation, specifically:

1. The syntax for superscript now requires a closing ^ (e.g. `superscript^2^`).
2. The WordPress-style LaTeX equation syntax (e.g. `$latex <equation>$`) is no longer supported.

Note that if you are using RStudio you can force RStudio to render documents using R Markdown v1 by adding the following special comment to your source file:

<pre>&lt;!-- rmarkdown v1 --&gt;</pre>

For rendering R Markdown v1 documents outside of RStudio you can continue to use the **markdown** package.
