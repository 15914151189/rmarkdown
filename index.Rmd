## Overview

R Markdown is an authoring format that enables easy creation of dynamic documents, presentations, and reports from R. It combines the core syntax of markdown (an easy-to-write plain text format) with embedded R code chunks that are run so their output can be included in the final document. R Markdown documents are fully *reproducible* (they can be automatically regenerated whenever underlying R code or data changes).

With R Markdown you can author a single source file that can be used to generate output in many formats including HTML, PDF, and MS Word. R Markdown isn't limited to just plain documents either, extensive support for HTML5 and PDF (Beamer) presentations is also included.

Under the hood, R Markdown is based on the [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) package and [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) document conversion utility. A quick tour to introduce you to R Markdown is included below. If you are already familiar with R Markdown and want more in-depth details, see:

* The [authoring guide](authoring_overview.html) for a detailed review of supported features and syntax.
* The documentation for the various supported output formats (e.g. [HTML](html_document_format.html), [PDF](pdf_document_format.html), [Word](word_document_format.html)).
* The specifiation for [R Markdown v2](rmarkdown_v2_specification.html) and details on [migrating](rmarkdown_v1_migration.html) from R Markdown v1.

## Quick Tour

### Prerequisites

You can use R Markdown either through the the integrated support for R Markdown within RStudio or via the **rmarkdown** package. To get started:

1. RStudio --- Install the current [RStudio Preview Release](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/preview).

2. Other envrionments --- Install the [rmarkdown package](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown) from GitHub.

### Markdown Basics

Markdown is a simple formatting language designed to make authoring content easy for everyone. Rather than writing complex markup code (e.g. HTML or LaTeX), Markdown enables the use of a syntax much more like plain-text email. For example the file on the left shows basic Markdown and the resulting output on the right:

### R Code Chunks

Within an R Markdown file, R Code Chunks can be embedded using the native Markdown syntax for fenced code regions. For example, the following code chunk computes a data summary and renders a plot as a PNG image:

![Markdown Chunk](images/markdownChunk.png)


### Inline R Code

You can also evaluate R expressions inline by enclosing the expression within a single back-tick qualified with 'r'. For example, the following code:

![Markdown Inline](images/markdownInline.png)

Results in this output: "I counted 2 red trucks on the highway."

### Embedding Equations

You can embed LaTeX or MathML equations in R Markdown files using the following syntax:

* *`$equation$`* for inline equations (note there must not be whitespace adjacent to the $ delimiters)
* *`$$ equation $$`* for display equations
* *`<math ...> </math>`* for MathML equations.

For example:

![Equation Inline](images/equations_inline.png)

The article on [Equations in R Markdown](authoring_equations.html) includes more detailed information on embedded equations.
